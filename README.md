# C++-Code

Assume that a Bus has total 50 seats. The arrangement is like 10 Rows and each Row contains 5 seats. Assume that Row 1 is reserved
for Disabled category (D), Row 2 to Row 5 for Women's (W) category and Remaining for General (G) (All categories including
Disabled, Women's and Men's; If reserved category full then general category would be utilized).
Write a C++ program to do the seats allocation as per the reservation and display the same. The program should display the seat
matrix as shown below in Figure 1 and ask the customer to provide the following data:
 Reserved Category (like D, W, G)
 Seat Number(like 1, 2, 3, …)
If the data valid then allocate the seat and display the seat matrix after the allocation. If not possible (like
seats full or mismatch in the category and seat number) then display the message "Not Allocated").
The program should be Menu-driven program to take the user choice for reservation and display the result till the user not interested
further.
